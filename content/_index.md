I’m a Junior in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I love mathematics and physics as well, and as such I am pursuing a maths minor. I like mobile dev and theoretical computer science too! Currently taking interest in compiler design on my own.

##Some cool projects I’ve done for fun:
While learning Java on my own, I wrote a program utilizing the BigDecimal object that can calculate π (pi) to any user-specified level of precision. I’ve checked its accuracy out to 300,000 digits, and it can calculate 10,000 digits in under 1 second running on my laptop.
More recently, while taking linear algebra, I wanted a programming application for the course. I had been interested in the heat equation and data visualization, so I wrote a Python script that makes use of NumPy’s ndarray to solve a discretized form of the heat equation on an infinitesimally thin homogeneous metal sheet and displays it via MatPlotLib.
